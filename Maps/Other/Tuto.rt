## ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Welcome To The Tutorial Scene ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ##
##
## Rt's File Is store with different part
##
## [Header] Is the Main part, He need to be the first on the scene
## This Part choose how many light/cam/item is on the scene, load texture, boune ...
##
[header]
	xscreen : 600
	yscreen : 600
	quality : 1
	bounce : 0
	refresh : 1
	camera : 1
	object : 6
	light : 1
	nb_normal : 1
	nb_texture : 1
	normal : "./Texture/Normal/Coussin.tga"
	textures : "./Texture/Texture/Jinx.tga"
##
##  Xscreen Yscreen is the size of the screen [0 => 16k] (pixel)
##  Quality is the number of pixel per ray (Increase the fps but loose the quality) [0 => 3]
##  Bounce is the special effect on object like, Reflection, Refraction and Normal
##  Refresh is to choose what's will happend after the Rendering of the first Screen (Screenshot/Quit/...)
##  Camera Is the Numbers of camera on the scene /!\ If the Numbers of Camera/Light/Object is higher than the real number he will just allocated more memory for nothing
##  Object Is the Numbers of Object on the scene
##  Light Is the Numbers of Light on the Scene
##  Nb_normal is the Numbers of Normal Map on the scene
##  Nb_texture is the Numbers of Texture on the scene
##
[light:BasicLight]
	origin : {0 -0.5 -1}
	color : 0xFFFFFF
	distance : 10
	intensity : 1
##
##  Light Section (Can be set everywhere on the file after the Header's Part)
##	After The ':' In the Declaration Line is the Name of the Item (Can Be set Everything)
##  Origin is the position in the scene of the light
##  Color is the Light's color, store in ARGB32, Need to be choose in Hexadecimal Value
##  Distance is how far the Light can be illuminate the scene
##  Intensity [0 => 1] Is the Intensity of the light
##
[camera:BasicCam]
	origin : {0 0 -0.5}
	direction : {0 0 1}
##
##	Camera Section (Can be set everywhere on the file after the Header's Part)
##	After The ':' In the Declaration Line is the Name of the Item (Can Be set Everything)
##  Origin is the position in the scene of the camera
##	Direction is where the camera is looking
##	Need To Know : The Screen of the camera is at 0.5 in the direction So this camera's screen is at {0 0 0}
##
[object:sphere]
	origin : {0.5 0 1}
	color : 0x7F7F7F
	rayon : 0.3
			id_texture : 0
			id_normal : 0
			reflection : 125
			refraction : 125
			opacity : 125
			texture : 125
			normal : 0
			mv : 1
			ns : 0
##	You cant name an object, the type of object is his name [sphere, plan, cylinder, cone]
##	The Effect section is some different thing you can apply, Like Reflection, Refraction ...
##	Id_texture is which texture is select
##	Id_normal is which normal is select
##	Reflection [0 => 255]
##	Refraction [0 => 255]
##	Opacity [0 => 255]
##	Texture [0 => 255]
##	Normal [0 => 255]
##	Mv actuve the rotation of the texture
##	Disable the light / Shadow
[object:plan]
	origin : {0 0.5 0}
	direction : {0 -1 0}
	color : 0x7F7F7F
		[effect]
[object:cylinder]
	origin : {0 0 0}
	direction : {0 -1 0}
	color : 0x7F7F7F
	rayon : 0.1
[object:cone]
	origin : {0.5 0 0}
	direction : {1 0 0}
	color : 0x7F7F7F
	angle : 30
[object:triangle]
	origin : {-0.5 -1.5 1.5}
	direction : {0 0 1}
	p2 : {1.5 -1.5 1.5}
	p3 : {0.5 1 2}
	color : 0x7F0000
			refraction : 125
			texture : 255
